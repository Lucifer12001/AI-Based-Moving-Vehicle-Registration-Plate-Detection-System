# AI-Based-Moving-Vehicle-Registration-Plate-Detection-System
The AI-based Moving Vehicle Registration Plate Detection System project aims to design, develop, and deploy an intelligent system that can detect and recognize license plates on moving vehicles using computer vision techniques. The project scope includes developing a system that can detect and recognize license plates with high accuracy, process video streams from cameras installed on roads, highways, or any surveillance system, extract license plate information, and store recognized license plates and associated vehicle information in a database. The system must be able to operate in real-time, with a maximum latency of 2 seconds, and handle various lighting conditions, including daylight, nighttime, and low-light environments. Additionally, the system must be scalable and able to handle high volumes of video streams and license plate data. The project deliverables include a fully functional system, a detailed system design document, a user manual, and technical documentation. The project assumes that high-quality cameras will be provided and a suitable computing infrastructure will be available, and depends on the availability of a dataset of annotated license plate images for training and testing the system. The project excludes the installation and maintenance of cameras and computing infrastructure, as well as the development of a comprehensive traffic management system or integration with existing systems.
